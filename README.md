PROTOTYPE OF A SELF MADE GITHUB PROFILE. I'LL BE CHANGING AS WE GO.

HI, MY NAME IS SOUMYADIP BHOWMIK.
I'M A CIVIL ENGINEER BUT WITH A PASSION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. I'M CURRENTLY A 4TH YEAR UNDERGRADUATE IN CIVIL ENGINEERING. I ASPIRE TO BECOME A SUCCESSFULL SOFTWARE DEVELOPER AND I'M SELF STUDING MY WAY INTO IT. I'M HERE TO FULLFILL A COMMITMENT THAT I'VE MADE TO MYSELF AND I'M NOT STOPPING BEFORE THAT.

I HAVE FEW TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT I'M DEVELOPING SLOWLY. SOME OF THEM ARE C LANGUAGE, C++, JAVA AND PYTHON. AS IM STILL WORKING MY WAY ON DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS I'VE SUCCESFULLY COMPLETED A PROJECT ON IOT WITH SOME HELP.
